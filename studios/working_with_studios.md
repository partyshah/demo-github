## 🤔 How does the process work?

- ⚙️ **Scoping.** Our engineering and technical product managers will work with you to scope a contract project. This will happen over a series of 1-3 calls with your team. At the end of this process, we will agree on a set of features, the staffing needed, and a timeline.
- 👩🏾‍💻 **Staffing.** We would find the best engineers from our pool for that project. We have data on every Lambda graduate and based on the needed skillset, we will find a perfect match for the project.

    - 👀 **Creating a browsing platform for recruiters.**  We used Next.js, GraphQL, and PostgreSQL to design, build, and deploy a platform for recruiters to browse candidates through various filters.
